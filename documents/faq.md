**Q: What does *DaltonicBot* do?**

*A:* DaltonicBot aims at providing enhanced pictures for redditors with Daltonism (also know as Colorblindness). It also simulates what colorblind users see to help non-colorblind users understand these.


**Q: What is Daltonism (aka colorblindness)?**

*A:* [Information about colorblindess can be found here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness)


**Q: This image doesn't have problematic colors and didn't need to be modified.**

*A:* The bot is not yet able to distinguish pictures that have problematic colors yet! The feature is in development. [Here's an example of the issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/6uvp1e/jaguar_water_tension/dlwtz1x/?context=3)


**Q: I am colorblind and the enhanced images do not help at all.**

*A:* The bot is still a work in progress and tests are currently being ran to improve the capabilities of the bot.


**Q: Why do I see Tritan-enhanced images better even if I have deutaranopia or protanopia?**

*A:* The tritan enhanced images use blue color filters to point out certain aspects of a picture. Blue is easily seen by deuteranopia and protanopia individuals hence why you seem to get better results when looking at those enhanced pictures.


**Q: On which subreddits is the bot currently running?**

*A:* The bot is currently running on r/pics, r/pic and r/ColorBlind/


**Q: How does the bot choose which images to convert?**

*A:* As of now the bot answers to new posts that are created after it has started running and which reach the frontpage of hot for that subreddit (top 25 hot)


**Q: Is the bot open source?**

*A:* It has not been open sourced yet. Currently working on a few additional features before it is open sourced.


**Q: I think this bot is too spammy and I do not want to see its replies anymore.**

*A:* Currently looking at different possibilities to make it less intrusive and the ability for users to easily block the bot if they do not want to see his replies.
